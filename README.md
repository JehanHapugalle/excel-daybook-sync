# Excel Daybook Synchronization

A Python script that automates the synchronization of coupon data from multiple Excel files to an output daybook. It reads the date and checks for red text in the coupon column, then appends matching rows to an Excel output file. The script also generates a summary report of validation results from each sheet, supporting manual cross-checking. Utilizes openpyxl for Excel handling and python-dotenv for secure configuration management.
